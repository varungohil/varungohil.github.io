Hi there! Welcome to my virtual estate. I am a Ph.D. student at [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) working with [Prof. Christina Delimitrou](https://people.csail.mit.edu/delimitrou/).

Currently, I spend my time thinking about how to address the issues of interpretability and generalizability of machine learning models when they are used for computer systems tasks. I'm also interested in designing datacenter servers for emerging microservice and serverless applications.

Before joining MIT, I worked with [Prof. Manu Awasthi](https://manuawasthi.in/), [Prof. Joycee Mekie](https://joycee.people.iitgn.ac.in/) and [Prof. Rajeev Balasubramonian](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/) on  approximate computing, computer arithmetic representations, neural network compression, computer architecture for smartphones, hybrid memory systems and autonomous vehicles.
<!-- My research interests span the entire computing stack. I am specifically fascinated by the subject of computer architecture and firmly believe that better system design would play crucial role for progress in computer technology. -->

<!-- , be it machine learning or genomics. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
