Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) working with [Prof. Christina Delimitrou](https://people.csail.mit.edu/delimitrou/). I design and optimize datacenter infrastructure by leveraging machine learning to drive system performance and efficiency.

My current research explores:
- Resilient ML-driven systems: Improving reliability of systems that use ML policies for autonomous decision-making.
- LLM-driven heuristic design: Using LLMs to discover and synthesize novel heuristics for system management.
- Accelerator design and programming: Exploring LLM-driven accelerator design and defining programming abstractions that simplify hardware optimization.


I earned my Master’s at MIT, where I developed a frequency-aware request scheduler for microservices by modifying the Thrift RPC framework. I completed my undergraduate studies at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/), during which I worked on approximate computing, memory systems, and hardware for autonomous vehicles with Profs. [Manu Awasthi](https://manuawasthi.in/), [Joycee Mekie](https://joycee.people.iitgn.ac.in/) and [Rajeev Balasubramonian](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/)

<!-- For my Master's thesis I designed a request-level power manager for microservices, for which I modified the Thrift RPC framework to perform intelligent frequency-aware request scheduling.

I completed my undergraduate at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/). During my undergraduate days, I worked with [Prof. Manu Awasthi](https://manuawasthi.in/), [Prof. Joycee Mekie](https://joycee.people.iitgn.ac.in/) and [Prof. Rajeev Balasubramonian](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/) on  approximate computing, computer arithmetic representations, neural network compression, computer architecture for smartphones, hybrid memory systems and autonomous vehicles. -->
<!-- My research interests span the entire computing stack. I am specifically fascinated by the subject of computer architecture and firmly believe that better system design would play crucial role for progress in computer technology. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
