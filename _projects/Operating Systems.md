I was a teaching assistant for [Operating Systems Course](https://nipunbatra.github.io/os2019/) at IIT Gandhinagar under [Prof. Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/).

Along with my amazing co-TAs, [Rishiraj](https://rishi-a.github.io/) and Shreyas, I managed 10 operating system labs that focused on various topics of virtuaization, concurrency and file systems.

I also gave a lecture on assembly language. Slides below:
