PRIMES is a program organized by MIT where high school students work on a year-long research project under the guidance of MIT Ph.D. students 

In 2023, my lab-mate [Nikita](https://www.nikita.tech/) and I co-advised two high school students - Alan Song and Evan Ning.

Alan and Evan worked on using reinforcement learning (RL) for deciding the scale of containers in a serverless environment. 
They coded up the entire infrastructure needed to run RL-based experiments with serverless. You can find their code here:

  </a>

With the infrastructure, they obtained preliminary results by applying Deep Q-Learning for horizantal and vertical autoscaling of serverless containers. They present these results in the PRIMES conference. The slides of their presentation are below:
